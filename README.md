# Comp3010
Github Repository containing code and documentation for the Comp3010 CW2 Coursework

**Introduction (10%)**
_(Provide an overview of the SOC context, the BOTSv3 exercise, and the objectives of your
investigation. Clearly define scope and assumptions.)_

This report will cover the analysis of the dataset BOTSv3. Analysis was performed by the tool "Splunk" which allows filtering and formatting of data in large datasets, using this tool we can audit and analyse the operations performed captured in the dataset, who they were performed by, when they were performed and information about the technical specifics behind the users and tools used.


**SOC Roles & Incident Handling Reflection (10%)**
_(Reflect on how SOC tiers, responsibilities, and incident handling methodologies relate to
the BOTSv3 exercise. Discuss prevention, detection, response, and recovery phases.)_

**Installation & Data Preparation (15%)**
_(Document Splunk installation, dataset ingestion, and validation steps. Provide supporting
evidence (screenshots/configs). Justify setup choices in the context of SOC infrastructure.)_




**Guided Questions (40%)**
_(Choose and answer ONE SET of BOTSv3’s 200-level questions using Splunk queries and
analysis. Present answers clearly, with supporting evidence (screenshots, query outputs,
dashboards). Explain the SOC relevance of each answer.)_
